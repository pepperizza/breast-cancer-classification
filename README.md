# breast-cancer-classification

## Overview
This repository contains machine learning implementations for breast cancer classification using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset. It explores both traditional statistical methods and neural network approaches to classify tumors as malignant or benign.

## Dataset
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset is a classic and widely used dataset in machine learning for binary classification.
Dataset Characteristics:

Instances: 569

Features: 30 (computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate of a breast mass)

Target: Binary (Malignant/Benign)

Feature Information: Each feature represents various characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image, including:

Radius
Texture
Perimeter
Area
Smoothness
Compactness
Concavity
Concave points
Symmetry
Fractal dimension


## Implemented Models
Logistic Regression:
- Feature selection and analysis
- Decision boundary
- Performance evaluation including all properties

Deep Neural Network:
- Multi-layer neural network architecture comparision
- LeakyReLU activation function
- Comprehensive evaluation using confusion matrix

## Prerequisites
python >= 3.7
scikit-learn 
numpy 
matplotlib 
pandas
